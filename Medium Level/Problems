--------------------Medium-Level Pointer Problems:-----------------


1.Dynamic Memory Allocation: Allocate an array of integers dynamically using malloc and free the memory after use.
2.Passing Pointers to Functions: Write a function that accepts a pointer to an array and calculates the sum of its elements.
3.Pointer Arrays: Implement a program where an array of strings is stored and printed using an array of pointers.
4.Pointer to Structure: Create a structure for a Student and use a pointer to access and modify its fields.
5.String Manipulation: Write a function that takes a string as a pointer and reverses the string in-place.

-------------Here's a breakdown of which topics are covered by the problems:-------------------

Dynamic Memory Allocation – Problem 1 (Pointers and Dynamic Memory, Stack vs Heap, Malloc/Calloc/Free)

Passing Pointers to Functions – Problem 2 (Pointers as Function Arguments, Arrays as Function Arguments)

Pointer Arrays – Problem 3 (Pointers and Arrays, Character Arrays and Pointers)

Pointer to Structure – Problem 4 (Pointers to Structures)

String Manipulation – Problem 5 (Character Arrays and Pointers)
