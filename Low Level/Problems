                ------------Low-Level Pointer Problems:---------------


1.Pointer Basics: Write a program to declare an integer, assign a value, and print the value using both the variable and a pointer.
2.Pointer Arithmetic: Create a program to demonstrate how pointer arithmetic works with arrays (e.g., print elements of an array using pointer increment).
3.Swapping Values: Write a function using pointers to swap two integers.
4.Pointer to Pointer: Declare an integer, a pointer to it, and a pointer to the pointer. Use them to print the value.
5.Null Pointer: Write a program that declares a pointer, assigns it to NULL, and checks for the null condition before dereferencing.


-------------------------Here's a breakdown of which topics are covered by the problems:------------------------

Pointer Basics – Problem 1 (Pointer Types, Dereferencing)

Pointer Arithmetic – Problem 2 (Pointer Arithmetic)

Swapping Values – Problem 3 (Pointers as Function Arguments, Call by Reference)

Pointer to Pointer – Problem 4 (Pointers to Pointers)

Null Pointer – Problem 5 (Pointer Types)
